## Updated Technology Stack Recommendations

### Core Stack (Confirmed Good Choices)
```yaml
Frontend: Tauri 2.0 + React + TypeScript
Backend: FastAPI + Python 3.12
State Management: XState v5
Voice Processing: Whisper v3 (local)
Intent Parsing: GPT-4o-mini (cost-optimized)
```

### Enhanced Stack (New Recommendations)
```yaml
Document Processing: Unstructured.io + LlamaParse
Data Analytics: Polars (primary) + Pandas (fallback)
Database: DuckDB (analytics) + SQLite (metadata)
Encryption: Age (files) + AES-256-GCM (config)
Monitoring: OpenTelemetry + Local metrics
```

### Alternative Considerations
```yaml
TTS: ElevenLabs API (better quality) vs OpenAI TTS (ecosystem)
Intent Parsing: Claude 3.5 Sonnet (accuracy) vs GPT-4o-mini (cost)
STT: Distil-Whisper (performance) vs Whisper v3 (accuracy)
```

## Security Architecture Updates

### Modern Security Patterns (2025)

#### Zero Trust Architecture
```typescript
interface SecurityContext {
  userIdentity: VerifiedIdentity;
  deviceTrust: TrustLevel;
  networkSecurity: NetworkPolicy;
  dataClassification: DataLabel;
}
```

#### Secure Enclaves for Sensitive Operations
```rust
// Tauri backend with secure processing
#[tauri::command]
async fn process_sensitive_data(
    data: EncryptedData,
    context: SecurityContext
) -> Result<ProcessedData, SecurityError> {
    // Process in isolated environment
}
```

#### Privacy-Preserving Analytics
```python
# Differential privacy for usage analytics
from opendp import dp
from opendp.measurements import make_base_discrete_laplace

def private_usage_metrics(events: List[Event]) -> PrivateMetrics:
    # Add noise to prevent user identification
    pass
```

## Performance Optimizations (2025 Best Practices)

### Voice Processing Pipeline
```python
# Streaming STT with VAD (Voice Activity Detection)
import webrtcvad
from faster_whisper import WhisperModel

class OptimizedSTT:
    def __init__(self):
        self.vad = webrtcvad.Vad(3)  # Aggressive VAD
        self.whisper = WhisperModel("distil-large-v3")
    
    async def stream_transcribe(self, audio_stream):
        # Only process when voice detected
        if self.vad.is_speech(audio_chunk, sample_rate):
            yield await self.whisper.transcribe(audio_chunk)
```

### Intent Parsing Optimization
```python
# Caching and batching for API efficiency
from functools import lru_cache
import asyncio

class OptimizedIntentParser:
    @lru_cache(maxsize=1000)
    async def parse_intent(self, text: str) -> ParsedIntent:
        # Cache common intents
        pass
    
    async def batch_parse(self, texts: List[str]) -> List[ParsedIntent]:
        # Batch API calls for efficiency
        pass
```
